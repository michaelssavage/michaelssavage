### [eMot](https://github.com/michaelssavage/eMot)
- My 4th Year project was a customisable client based emotion classifier. The system uses data extraction, natural language processing, emotion classification, and machine learning to judge the sentiment of textual material being read online by a user.
- The interface is built using PYQT5 and the QT Designer. These Python tools are wrappers of the QT C++ libraries.
